## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Native Javascript


### What I learned

I feel like the more of these that I do, the more I learn about how to manipulate CSS in ways that I never learned in college, which is exciting. I learned a lot about how to display data manipulation on the web. With the way that I did it, I have the ability to extrapolate it onto full math functions. Might add the buttons for that once I fix some of the little issues I have been having with this project.

### Continued development

Continuing on this project, I would like to fix the theme button only working by clicking on the numbers. I want to implement it so that the button works by sliding it back and forth too. Also I need to add mobile compatability as well.
